## Medical Image Processing with Python

Pre-processing stage of images [depicting dermatological diseases](https://github.com/danaespentz/biomed/blob/main/lab.ipynb): All the images contain some form of disease, but the shape is indefinite. With image segmentation in some way, precisely identifying the boundaries of the pathology, I try to extract statistical and morphological features that can be used for diagnosing new images.


## Big Data in Healthcare

In this [project](https://github.com/danaespentz/biomed/blob/main/spentzouDanae03120237.R) I was required to perform some statistical data analysis using the R programming language within the integrated development environment RStudio. After downloading the [usingR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/UsingR/) package, which contains various datasets, I installed the "wellbeing" dataset. This dataset essentially comprises a data frame with information from 22 European countries regarding what makes people happy based on 10 different parameters.


## Statistical medical data analysis

In this [project](https://github.com/danaespentz/biomed/blob/main/lab3.R) I performed some statistical data analysis using the R programming language and the package RISmed (histograms, barplots, treemaps).
